This repository is part of the [PomfCrypt](/pomfcrypt) project. It holds the code for the main API and backend of PomfCrypt.

## Technology

The backend is written in Golang. For more detailed documentation about the cryptography, refer to the [meta repository](/pomfcrypt/pomfcrypt/).

## Maintainers

This project is an educational project and not intended for production usage.
It lacks security aspects of a production-grade web application and is not fully end-to-end encrypted by-design.
Please refer to other solutions if you need a reliable pomf service.
This is also the reason for the extensive comments in the code. I am required to do so by my school.
